## Summary

This game was born at the GGJ Santiago, San Joaqu√≠n 2018. It's just a series of minigames, it will be updated as long as we figure out stuff to improve, probably.

## Requisites

This is a project made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine, it started in version 3.0-RC1 and is soon to be ported to 3.0-stable. As such, the one and only requisite to run this project is Godot 3.0.

Additionally, the [Godot export templates](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0/Godot_v3.0-stable_export_templates.tpz) are required to export and run the project on platforms different than your own.

## Instructions

Open the Godot executable, and in the project list import the project.godot file contained in this repo. That's it.

## Exporting

When exporting this project don't forget to add "\*.txt" in the "Filters to export non-resource files" list in the "Resources" tab in the export window, this will include the additional resources that were written outside the engine itself (dictionary, lines of code, help files).

This game has been tested to work on Windows, Mac OSX Sierra, Linux and WebAssembly.
