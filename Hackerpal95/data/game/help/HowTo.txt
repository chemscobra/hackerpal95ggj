==== TERMINALS ====
You can attack any terminal that's lit up and hasn't been already infected. Larger terminals give you greater payoffs, but they're more difficult!

==== LOCKS ====
Unlock all the nodes in order to progress, when you click a node, it toggles its state, and the state of all adjacent locks, use your brains, kid.

==== PASSWORDS ====
You just have to enter the passwords into the system, they're literally in front of you, there's a time limit but just don't mess it up, use your reflexes, kid.

==== CODING ====
Code as hard as you can, the screen will tell you what letters you should press, and you should press them as quickly as possible, use your might, kid.
